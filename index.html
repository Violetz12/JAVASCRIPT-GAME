            <h1>Escape the cat!</h1>
            <p>
              We've created an interactive experience with lovely P5.JS and
              we're excited to have you check it out!!! It's an escape room game
              where you solve puzzles to escape the cat. You and a friend play
              as a mouse and a bird, and you'll need to work together to get out
              before the cat catches you (jumpscare alert!).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Mouse can crawl through tight spaces üê≠ Bird can fly over stuff
              and hit switchesüê¶ Team up, solve puzzles fast, and escape before
              time runs out!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The game is designed to be played on desktop or laptop devices. If
              you encounter issues with the game not displaying, please try

        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
          Two players must work together to escape before time runs out. One
          player uses the arrow keys, the other uses WASD. Each character has
          unique abilities‚Äîone can fly, and the other can slip through tight
          spaces. Use your strengths, solve puzzles, and communicate well... or
          well you'll see...
